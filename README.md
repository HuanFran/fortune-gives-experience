# Fortune Gives Experience

A lightweight minecraft mod that alleviates the grind of farming for experience. Allows the fortune and looting enchantments to grant additional experience, scaling with the enchantment level. The default scaling factor is 0.5, meaning that each enchantment level grants +0.5x experience gain. This scaling factor can be modified in the configs.

Available for 1.12.2, 1.15.2, and 1.16.3. 

It takes very little effort to port this mod to other versions, so I am willing to do so if requested.
